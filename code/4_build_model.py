Build the neural network

Neural networks comprise of layers/modules that perform operations on data.
The torch.nn namespace provides all the building blocks you need to build your own
neural network. Every module in PyTorch subclasses the nn.Module.
A neural network is a module itself that consists of other modules (layers).
This nested structure allows for building and managing complex architectures easily.

from torch import nn
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from torchvision import datasets, transforms

'''
Get device for training
We want to be able to train our model on a hardware accelerator like the GPU or MPS,
if available. Let's check to see if torch.cuda or torch.backends.mps are available,
otherwise we use the CPU.
'''

device = (
    "cuda"
    if torch.cuda.is_available()
    else "mps"
    if torch.backends.mps.is_available()
    else "cpu"
)
# print(f"Using {device} device")


'''
Define the class

We define our neural network by subclassing nn.Module,
initializing the neural network layers in "__init__". Every nn.Module subclass implements
the operations on input data in the "forward" method.
'''


class CustomNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.flatten = nn.Flatten()
        self.linear_relu_stack = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(28*28, 512),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(512, 512),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(512, 10),
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.flatten(x)
        logits = self.linear_relu_stack(x)
        return logits


# create an instance of CustomNN and move it to the device
model = CustomNN().to(device)
# print(model)


'''
To use the model, we pass it the input data. This executes the model's forward,
along with some background operations. Do not call model.forward() directly!

Calling the model on the input returns a 2-dimensional tensor with 
dim=0 corresponding to each output of 10 raw predicted values for each class,
and dim=1 corresponding to the individual values of each output.
We get the prediction probabilities by passing it through 
an instance of the nn.Softmax module.
'''
X = torch.rand(1, 28, 28, device=device)
logits = model(X)
pred_probab = nn.Softmax(dim=1)(logits)
y_pred = pred_probab.argmax(1)
# print(f"Predicted class: {y_pred}")


'''
Model Layers
Let's break down the layers in the FashionMNIST model. 
To illustrate, we will take a sample minibatch of 3 images of size 28x28
and see what happens when we pass it through the network.
'''

input_image = torch.rand(3, 28, 28)
# print(input_image.size())

'''
nn.Flatten
We initialize the nn.Flatten layer to convert each 2D 28x28 pixel image
into a contiguous array of 784 pixel values.
'''
flatten = nn.Flatten()
flat_image = flatten(input_image)
# print(flat_image.size())

'''
nn.Linear
The linear layer is a module that applies a linear transformation
on the input using its stored weights and biases.
'''
layer1 = nn.Linear(in_features=28*28, out_features=20)
hidden1 = layer1(flat_image)
# print(hidden1.size())

'''
nn.ReLU
Non-linear activations are what create the complex mappings between the
model's inputs & outputs. They are applied after linear transformations
to introduce "nonlinearity", helping neural networks learn a wide variety of phenomena.

In this model, we use nn.ReLU between out linear layers.
'''

# print(f"Before ReLU: {hidden1}\n\n")
# hidden1 = nn.ReLU()(hidden1)
# print(f"After ReLU: {hidden1}")

'''
nn.Sequential
An ordered container of modules, data is passed through all modules in definition order.
Sequential containers can be used quickly build networks such as "seq_modules" below.
'''
seq_modules = nn.Sequential(
    flatten,
    layer1,
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(20, 10)
)
input_image = torch.rand(3, 28, 28)
logits = seq_modules(input_image)

'''
nn.Softmax
The last linear layer of a neural network returns "logits", 
raw values [-infty,infty] which are passed to nn.Softmax.
These logits are scaled to values [0,1] representing probabilities predicted for each class,
"dim" indicates the dimension along which the values must sum to 1.
'''

softmax = nn.Softmax(dim=1)
pred_probab = softmax(logits)

'''
Model Parameters
Many layers inside a neural netowrk are "parameterized" i.e. they have associated weights
& biases optimized during training. Subclassing nn.Module automatically tracks all fields
defined inside your model object, making all paramters accessible using your model's 
"parameters()" or "named_parameters()" methods.
'''
# iterate over each parameter, printing its size and value
print(f'Model Structure:\n{model}')
for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    print(f'''
        Layer: {name}
        Size: {param.size()}
        Values:
            {param[:2]}
    ''')
